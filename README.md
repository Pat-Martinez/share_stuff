Share Stuff Project
===================

Share Stuff is a web app that helps people share stuff
(e.g. tools, camping gear, kitchen stuff, etc).  It allows members
to list items that they are willing to share and keeps track of
what items are on loan to another member.

Share Stuff is my class project while attending the PDX Code Guild
Bootcamp. 

Share Stuff is based on the web app Neighbor Goods,
neighborgoods.net.
