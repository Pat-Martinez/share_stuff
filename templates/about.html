  <h1>About Share Stuff</h1>
  <p>My first Web App created with Django.</p>
</div>

<p>This web app was my student project for the <a href="http://pdxcodeguild.com">PDX Code Guild</a>. I had so  much fun, and moments of maddening frustration, creating this project in Python and Django. I couldn't have done it without the generous help of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisfreemanpdx">Chris Freeman</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrischarlesjones">Chris Jones</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ben-kulp/30/181/247">Ben Kulp</a>.  Thanks guys!</p>

<p>This is a work in progress so I'll continue to improve this app and add features.</p>

<h3>SAMPLE MEMBER ACCOUNTS</h3>
<p><a href="/sharing/register">Register</a> as a member and add items to share or create a sharing group. Alternatively, check out the sample accounts below. Of course these accounts may change if someone logs in and adds or deletes items or accepts or rejects borrow or join requests.  I'll periodically check back and update these accounts.</p>
{% if sample_members %} 
{% for member in sample_members %}
  <ul>
    <li><b>Username</b>: {{ member.user.username}}, <b>Password</b>: letstrythis, 
    <br><b>Comments</b>: {{member.comment}}</li>
  </ul>
{% endfor %}  
{% else %}
  <strong>Currently, there are no sample member accounts.</strong>
{% endif %}
<br>

<h3>AVAILABLE SHARING GROUPS</h3>
<div class="row">
  <div class='col-md-8'>
    <ul class="list-group">
      {% if groups %}
      {% for group in groups %}
      <li class="list-group-item" style='min-height: 40px'>
        <a href="/groups/group_info/{{ group.id }}">{{ group.name }}</a> 
      </li>
      {% endfor %}
      {% endif %}
    </ul>
  </div>
</div> 
<br>

<h3>FUTURE FEATURES</h3>
<ul>

  <li>Enable group join request button to work</li>
  <li>Enable moderator to remove a member from their group.</li>
  <li>Enable member to edit one of their items.</li>
  <li>Enable member to see a list of items they've borrowed.</li>
  <li>Enable member to see a list of their items that are on loan.</li>
  <li>Enable the ability to search for items.</li>

  <li>Enable a javascript popup that asks a member to confirm their decision when they click the delete item button.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>BUGS</h3>
<ul>
<li>When a member joins more than one group all sorts of craziness can occur on the member page (home page).
<li>File validation of image files (item images, group images, profile images) hasn't been included, thus non-image files can be uploaded. Also need to set a file size limit.</li>
<li>Zip code validation hasn't been included on the registration page, thus invalid zipcodes can be added.</li>
<li>Help me squash bugs! If you find one, I'd greatly appreciate it if you notify me at <a href="mailto:martijam123-share...yahoo(dot)com">martijam123-share ... yahoo dot com</a></li>
