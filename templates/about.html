  <h1>About Share Stuff</h1>
  <p>My first Web App created with Django.</p>
</div>

<p>This web app was my student project for the <a href="http://pdxcodeguild.com">PDX Code Guild</a>. I had so  much fun, and moments of maddening frustration, creating this project in Python and Django. I couldn't have done it without the generous help of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisfreemanpdx">Chris Freeman</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrischarlesjones">Chris Jones</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ben-kulp/30/181/247">Ben Kulp</a>.  Thanks guys!</p>

<p>This is a work in progress so I'll continue to improve this app and add features.</p>

<h3>SAMPLE MEMBER ACCOUNTS</h3>
<p><a href="/sharing/register">Register</a> as a member and add items to share or create a sharing group. Alternatively, check out the sample accounts below. These sample accounts demonstrate how the home page dynamically changes depending upon the number of borrow requests, if a member belongs to a sharing group, etc.</p>

<p>Of course these accounts may change if someone logs in and adds/deletes items or accepts/rejects borrow or join requests.  I'll periodically check back and update these accounts.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Username</b>: sample_1, <b>Password</b>: letstrythis, 
      <br><b>Comments</b>: Bruno Sample has 3 items, 2 borrow requests and 2 join requests. He's the Moderator of the West Side Coders group.</li>
      <br>
    <li><b>Username</b>: sample_2, <b>Password</b>: letstrythis, 
      <br><b>Comments</b>: Ursula Sample has 2 items and 1 borrow request. She's a member of the West Side Coders Group.</li>
      <br>
    <li><b>Username</b>: sample_3, <b>Password</b>: letstrythis, 
      <br><b>Comments</b>: Zeus Sample has 1 item and does not belong to any groups.</li>
  </ul>  
<br>

<h3>BUGS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When a member joins more than one group all sorts of craziness can occur on the member page (home page).
  <li>File validation of image files (item images, group images, profile images) hasn't been included, thus non-image files can be uploaded. Also need to set a file size limit.</li>
  <li>Zip code validation hasn't been included on the registration page, thus invalid zipcodes can be added.</li>
  <li>Help me squash bugs! If you find one, I'd greatly appreciate it if you notify me at <a class="email" href="mailto:martijam123-share(at)yahoo(dot)com">martijam123-share at yahoo dot com</a></li>
